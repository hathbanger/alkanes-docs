# Developer Disclaimer

Welcome to Alkanes! We're excited to have you join us in building the future of Bitcoin smart contracts. While we've been developing these tools for over a year and have successfully deployed contracts to mainnet, it's important to understand where we are in our journey.

## Current Status

> **WARNING**  
> Alkanes is in its early stages - think of it as the dawn of a new era for Bitcoin development. While the core infrastructure is operational and we have working contracts on mainnet, we're still evolving rapidly. Use caution and avoid deploying high-value contracts at this time.

## Important Considerations

- **Early Development**: The protocol is functional but actively evolving. Expect frequent updates and improvements.
- **Testing Environment**: We strongly recommend extensive testing on testnet before any mainnet deployments.
- **Production Readiness**: At this stage, avoid deploying mission-critical applications or contracts handling significant Bitcoin values.
- **Community Driven**: We're building this together! Your feedback, bug reports, and contributions are essential to the protocol's growth.

## Getting Involved

- Join our Discord community for direct access to the development team
- Submit issues and PRs on GitHub - we welcome all contributions
- Share your experiences and help shape the future of Bitcoin smart contracts

## Why Build on Alkanes Now?

- Be among the first developers to shape Bitcoin's smart contract ecosystem
- Work directly with the core team to influence the protocol's direction
- Build foundational tools and applications that others will build upon
- Gain deep expertise in Bitcoin smart contract development

We're committed to building a robust, secure platform for Bitcoin smart contracts. While we're proud of what we've built so far, we believe in transparency about our current stage of development. Join us in this exciting journey of making Bitcoin programmable!

_Remember: The best innovations come from collaborative effort. Let's build something amazing together!_
