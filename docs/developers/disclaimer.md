# Welcome to the Future of Bitcoin Smart Contracts

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ We're stoked you're checking out Alkanes. You're looking at something pretty special - we've been cooking this up for over a year and have already deployed contracts to mainnet. But let's have a real talk about where we are.

:::warning
Real talk: We're in early days here. While we've got working contracts on mainnet and the core infrastructure is solid, we're moving fast and breaking things (in a good way). If you're thinking about mainnet deployments with serious money - maybe hold off for a bit.
:::

Here's the deal - you're early. Like, really early. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor of something big in the Bitcoin ecosystem. But with that comes some caveats:

- The protocol works, but we're iterating fast. Updates are coming hot and heavy.
- Always, always test on regtest and testnet first. Seriously.
- For now, keep the high-value stuff in your back pocket.

But here's why being early is awesome:
- You get direct access to our team (hop in our Discord!)
- Your voice actually matters - we're actively looking for feedback
- The stuff you build today will become the foundation others build on tomorrow
- You'll develop expertise in Bitcoin smart contracts before most people even know it's possible

Look, we could blow smoke but that's not our style. We're building something massive here, and it's working - but we're also honest about where we are in the journey. The real magic happens when developers like you jump in and start building.

Want in? Join our Discord, throw some PRs our way on GitHub, or just start tinkering. We're building the future of programmable Bitcoin, and there's plenty of room for pioneers.

Let's build something incredible together. ðŸš€
