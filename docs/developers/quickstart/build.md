# Build a contract

This section will guide you through the process of building an ALKANES token contract.

## Gated Mint contract

You will use the same test repo that you used for deploying the Free Mint example contract. This time you will modify and compile the contract before deploying to your regtest environment.

## 1. Set up and run ALKANES regtest

If you have not already done so, [set up and run your local ALKANES regtest environment](./setup.md). 

## 2. Clone the ALKANES example repo

If you [deployed the Free Mint example contract](./deploy.md), you will have already have cloned the ALKANES example repository. We will use the free mint contract as a starting point for our gated mint contract.

## 3. Development of contract

- Cloning the repo
- Development of contract
- Deploying to regtest
- Running tests
