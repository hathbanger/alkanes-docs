# Tutorial Intro

ALKANES is a token-based smart contract metaprotocol built on the protorunes framework using the protorunes standard. In this section we will modify and deploy a custom smart contract for distributing a new ALKANES token. The goal is to demonstrate the smart contract capabilities of ALKANES.

You will use a local Regtest instance to build and test your Alkane contract. 

You will use the Oyl SDK methods to deploy your contract to regtest and to test your contract methods.

While it is good to know how metashrew and protorunes work, you do not need to know the details in order to deploy and use ALKANES contracts.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Set up and run a local Bitcoin Regtest instance
2. Install and use utilities from Oyl SDK to interact with the regtest instance
3. Deploy an example ALKANES contract to the regtest instance
4. Learn how to modify an existing ALKANES contract
5. Deploy your modified contract to Signet and interact with it using a Signet explorer
