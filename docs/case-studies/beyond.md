Beyond is a native Bitcoin L1 interoperability protocol, providing the necessary infrastructure for users to securely bridge any token to, from, and within Bitcoin L1.

For developers utilizing this interoperability protocol, Beyond will be integrating Alkanes as an asset class, enabling less siloed and fractured liquidity across the metaprotocol space.

Beyond enables teams more flexibility when migrating to and from other Bitcoin L1 assets and standards into the new era of programmability with Alkanes.

Beyond is leveraging Alkanes to build advanced trading infrastructure directly on Bitcoin. Their implementation showcases how Alkanes can be used to create sophisticated financial instruments while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network.
