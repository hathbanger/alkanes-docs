Starknet's ambition is to become a premier settlement layer for Bitcoin via starks. The broader ecosystem has presented many paths towards a trustless zk verifier and bridge, but either require consensus upgrades or are premature in their development or design.

By expanding the indexer of Bitcoin asset standards unlocks insane scale. Alkanes enables zk-STARK based trustless teleportation to/from L1 via light-weight verifier/rollup in the indexer without consensus upgrades like OP_CAT.

Enter high TPS and AMMs on Starknet.
