Oyl is building the first trustless AMM to Bitcoin designed to fit the UTXO model.

Bitcoin fungible assets struggle with a lack of immediate buy and sell-side liquidity for traders. They also lack trustless and permissionless systems that enable liquidity providers to participate efficiently at scale.

Alkanes enables Oyl to deliver a permissionless protocol with on chain incentives that enables permissionless participation for pair creation and liquidity providers while ensuring composability with other DeFi applications.
